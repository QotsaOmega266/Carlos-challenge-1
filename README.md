# Carlos-challenge-1

## The task that presented to me is a webpage that contains non-semantic elements such as div and change them to the appropriate semantic HTML. MY approach to this was to observe each section of code on the html page at a time and determine what semantic is used in place of the divs, then I would obesrve the classes in the CSS sheet related to that section and change any of the div to the related section they belong in. I also had to make sure that the design of the application still remained intact with the associated changes.
